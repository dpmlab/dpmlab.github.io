# Types of positions in the lab

## Volunteer research assistants
If you are a Columbia student and would like to learn more about research in the lab, we are often looking for help with tasks such as designing and annotating stimuli, transcribing or coding verbal recall data, preparing presentation materials, and (for more experienced RAs) running experiments with human subjects. If interested, please email the lab manager at <columbiadpml@gmail.com> with your resume, a short description about why you are interested in working in the lab, and your availability.


## Independent study and Honors Program
If you are a Columbia student and are interested in working on a research project for course credit (UN3950 "Supervised Individual Research"), contact Dr. Baldassano <c.baldassano@columbia.edu> to inquire about the current availability of independent study positions in the lab. Sophomores should also consider applying for [the Psychology Honors Program](https://psychology.columbia.edu/content/honors-program) which involves supervised research during Junior and Senior year.


## Full-time summer research assistants
Over the summer, it is possible to work full-time as a paid research assistant on projects in the lab. Generally people who have already been involved in the lab are prioritized for these positions since they are limited in number. Alternatively, consider applying for research funding such as [through Columbia's research scholar programs](https://urf.columbia.edu/urf/research/programs), which can allow you to bring your own funding support to work in the lab.


## PhD students
PhD applications are handled through [a central application process](https://psychology.columbia.edu/content/preparing-apply) in the Psychology department, but you should reach out directly to Dr. Baldassano <c.baldassano@columbia.edu> before applying to inquire about whether he will be accepting students. Entrance to the Columbia Psychology PhD program is highly selective, as we receive hundreds of applications for fewer than a dozen positions, and substantial prior research experience (as an undergrad or post-undergrad) is typically necessary for your application to be competitive.


## Postdocs
Email Dr. Baldassano <c.baldassano@columbia.edu> to inquire about potential job openings for postdoctoral researchers in the lab. We also recruit postdocs through the Columbia [Center for Science and Society's Presidential Scholars program](https://scienceandsociety.columbia.edu/content/presidential-scholars-society-and-neuroscience).


# Diversity and Inclusion in the lab
Academic research has historically excluded many scientists due to factors including race, gender, socioeconomic background, sexual orientation, and disability. The DPM lab strives to create a working environment in which all lab members' perspectives and voices are valued. We are proud of the inclusive community we have built within the lab, but also recognize that correcting systemic inequalities requires ongoing and active work to make our field more equitable and welcoming for all people.


If you belong to a racial or ethnic group that is underrepresented in STEM and are interested in pursuing a PhD in Psychology, consider applying to the [Bridge to the PhD program](https://bridgetophd.facultydiversity.columbia.edu/content/program-overview), which provides two years of research and course experience in order to further strengthen your application for graduate study.
