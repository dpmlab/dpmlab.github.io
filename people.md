<tr>
<td style="width:200px"><img src="img/katie_mae_peters.png"></td>
<td style="width:280px"><b>Katie Mae Peters</b>: Katie Mae Peters' passion for action films started the moment she watched Keanu jump a bus over the gap in an incomplete LA freeway. Since then she spent the past ten years in the film industry gaining experience by working with everyone from Dog the Bounty Hunter to Ron Burgandy. Her eye for creative producing has led her to create several award winning films and earn several grants including a 2021 Hollywood Foreign Press Fellowship. She currently attends Columbia University where she is researching the negative impacts certain color grading and production design choices in film have on the way audiences form empathetic attachments to POC characters and foreign countries.

<td style="width:280px"><b>Yifang Liu</b>: As a junior studying Neuroscience and Behavior at the School of General Studies, Yifang is currently working on her senior thesis project that delves into the effects of agency on memory performance in multi-step sequential planning. Her project was inspired by her love for gaming and seeks to investigate how agency can impact memory in more realistic contexts. She also explores her passions for photography and video games in her free time. These creative pursuits serve as a wellspring of inspiration for her, especially when it comes to the naturalistic stimuli they offer!
