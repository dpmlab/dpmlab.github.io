## Undergraduate Senior Thesis students
<table style="width:100%">
<tr>
<td style="width:280px"><b>Katie Mae Peters</b>: Katie Mae Peters' passion for action films started the moment she watched Keanu jump a bus over the gap in an incomplete LA freeway. Since then she spent the past ten years in the film industry gaining experience by working with everyone from Dog the Bounty Hunter to Ron Burgandy. Her eye for creative producing has led her to create several award winning films and earn several grants including a 2021 Hollywood Foreign Press Fellowship. She currently attends Columbia University where she is researching the negative impacts certain color grading and production design choices in film have on the way audiences form empathetic attachments to POC characters and foreign countries.

She is interested in understanding the process underlying learning, specifically the ways in which information can be presented to maximize encoding, retention and later retrieval. In the future, she hopes to contribute to bridging the gap between cognitive psychology and education. That is, using contemporary knowledge on the functioning of memory systems to enrich classroom and learning experiences in general. Outside of school work, she enjoys reading and having "intellectual" conversations with friends.

Her project was inspired by her love for gaming and seeks to investigate how agency can impact memory in more realistic contexts. She also explores her passions for photography and video games in her free time. These creative pursuits serve as a wellspring of inspiration for her, especially when it comes to the naturalistic stimuli they offer!
