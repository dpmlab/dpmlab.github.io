### Postdocs
<table style="width:100%">
<tr>
<td style="width:280px"><b>Matthew Sachs</b> (Presidential Scholars in Society and Neuroscience program): Matt received his PhD from the University of Southern California’s in Dr. Antonio Damasio's Brain and Creativity Institute. His research focuses on modeling the neural and behavioral mechanisms involved in emotional and rewarding responses to naturalistic stimuli, such as music and film.

<td style="width:280px"><b>Jiawen Huang</b>: After finishing from UCL’s BSc Psychology program, Jiawen stayed at UCL as a RA to build a database of people watching movies in fMRI. He is interested in how memory works in context, such as during movie viewing. He also hopes to explore methods to study memory with more complex tasks such as interactive games.

<tr>
<td style="width:200px"><img src="img/caroline.jpg"></td>
<td style="width:280px"><b>Caroline Lee</b>, Volunteer research assistant: Caroline finished her MS in Computer Science at NYU's Courant Institute in 2017. She is interested in how the brain organizes and represents semantic structure and the use of machine-learning based joint-modeling approaches to explain the dynamics of brain and behavior. Her spare time is spent debugging TensorFlow code in Pat Shafto’s lab and attempting to play classical guitar.

<tr>
<td style="width:280px"><b>Labeebah Subair</b>, Summer research assistant: Labeebah is a rising sophomore at Yale University who hopes to pursue her undergraduate degree in psychology and neuroscience. She is interested in how the brain processes psychological trauma, formulates memories, and promotes habitual neural activity. This interest is rooted in her passion for social justice and hope to relate concepts of trauma to identity and discrimination.
